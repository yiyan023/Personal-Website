# Personal Portfolio Site ðŸš€

Hey there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my portfolio site! I wanted to build a platform that could showcase all my skills, interests, and accomplishments in a creative yet insightful way. While I love being a developer and building projects, there is much more to me than the code I write. I hope you enjoy :)
